This is an explanation of how this protocol works.
Note: This is a simplified explaination.

C stands for Client, S stands for Server.

Adding password:
C	S
|	|
|======>| (C) Hi Server, I'd like to add a password.
|	|
| <=====| (S) Okay, but you must sign it along with this seed.
|	|
|======>| (C) Hi Server, I'd like my private and public asymmetric keys.
|	|
| <=====| (S) Here is your encrypted private asymmetric key, and your public asymmetric key.
|	|
|======>| (C) Hi Server, here is my password and signature.
|	|
|	| (S) Verify signature. If correct, add password to database and reply valid. Else, say incorrect signature and end.
|	|
| <=====| (S) Valid/Invalid, close connection.

Getting password:
C	S
|	|
|======>| (C) Hi Server, I'd like to get my password.
|	|
| <=====| (S) Here is your encrypted password. Close connection.
|	|
|	| (C) Try to decrypt password using key.
